\section{Introduction}

When we have binomial data from different (but related) sources, we often want to share information between them. However, differences between the sources causes a false reduction in variance to pool the data together, and modeling them separately loses information. In this instance, I was interested in the variance between the sources. A typical model choice is a \textit{Beta-Binomial model} written

\begin{equation}\label{betabinom}
\theta_i \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)
\end{equation}

where the variance between the souces follows the definition of a Beta distribution with the approximated $\alpha, \beta$ parameters.
